% 
% Calculates the sum of the square errors between some input pupil size
% time series "data" and a time series created from the specifications and
% parameters in "model". If a MxN matrix with M time series is input into
% "data", the cost will be computed between each time series and the single 
% time series produced from "model" and summed.
% 
%   Inputs:
%   
%       data = a single pupil size time series as a row vector OR a MxN
%       matrix with M time series.
% 
%       samplerate = sampling rate of data in Hz.
% 
%       trialwindow = a 2 element vector containing the starting and ending
%       times (in ms) of the trial epoch.
% 
%       model = model structure created by pret_model and filled in by user.
%       Parameter values in model.ampvals, model.boxampvals, model.latvals,
%       model.tmaxval, and model.yintval must be provided.
%           *Note - an optim structure from pret_estimate, pret_bootstrap, or
%           pret_optim can be input in the place of model*
% 
%       options = options structure for pret_cost. Default options can be
%       returned by calling this function with no arguments.
% 
%   Outputs:
% 
%       cost = sum of the square errors between "data" and time series
%       created using "model"
% 
%   Options
%
%       pret_calc_options = options structure for pret_calc, which pret_cost uses
%       to produce the time series from "model".
