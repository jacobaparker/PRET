%% model time window and sample rate
% a two element vector delineating the end and start times (in ms) for the
% model (can be different than the trialwindow given for actual data)
%   > for example, if your trials are epoched -500 to 3500 ms, you might
%     only be interested in modeling 0 to 3500 ms
model.window = [];

% the sample rate (in Hz) you would like the model to work with (the
% samplerate in a sj structure will be used instead if used in a function
% that uses them)

% 2 by N matrices which contain the lower and upper bounds of each events's
% and each boxes's amplitude value for the constrained optimization. N is the
