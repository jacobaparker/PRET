function output = blinkinterp(trial,samplerate,th1,th2,bwindow,betblink)
%Based on method described in:
% Mathôt, Sebastiaan. (2013). A simple way to reconstruct pupil size during 
% eye blinks. FigShare. 10.6084/m9.figshare.688001
%
%blinkinterp detects blink regions in a pupil size timeseries, removes the
%regions, then interpolates through those regions using the surrounding
%data.
%
%This code only works if blinks are recorded as zeros preceded by a sharp
%drop in pupil size values and followed by a sharp rise in pupil size.
% 
% *DEVELOPED/OPTIMIZED FOR DATA COLLECTED WITH EYELINK WITH A SAMPLING 
%  RATE OF 1kHz*
%
%Blinks are detected by first finding the beginning and end location of
%each region of zeros in the trial. Zero regions that are sufficiently 
%close together are combined, making them a single blink. The code then
%looks bwindow datapoints away from the beginning/end of each zero region
%to find blink onset/blink offset. To determine onset/offset, the original
%time series is smoothed by convolving with a 11 ms Hanning window, and
%then a velocity profile is produced from the smoothed time series. The
%code finds blink onset for each blink by looking at the velocity profile
%in the bwindow period before the first zero and finding a value above a 
%set threshold. Blink offset is done the same on the bwindow period after 
%the last zero.
%
%The interpolation is accomplished by defining the blink onset point as t2 
%and the blink offset point as t3. A point in the data before blink
%onset and a point after blink offset are chosen (t1 and t4 respectively).
%The t1-t2 distance and t3-t4 distance are equal to the t2-t3 difference,
%unless the difference exceeds the value of betblink (an explanation of
%this can be found below). In this case, the t1-t2 and t3-t4 difference are
%set as equal to betblink (unless the data points at t1 or t4 equal 0 or
%nan, in which case t1/t4 is moved closer and closer to t2/t3 until a valid
%data point is found). Then, a cubic spline interpolation is performed using
%the four points. If t1=t2 and/or t3=t4, then the interpolation is only
%done with 3 or 2 points (the spline function can't handle repeat or out of
%order points).
%
%inputs: (values in parantheses relfect recommended values)
%   trial = vector time series of pupil size
%
%   samplerate = sample rate in Hz
%
%   th1 = (5) velocity threshold of pupil onset detection (set as a positive
%   number, but is really negative, i.e., the pupil area is decreasing) 
%
%   th2 = (3) velocity threshold of pupil offset detection (is positive in both
%   input and in script). Pupil offset is more gradual than
%   onset, so a more sensitive (i.e., lower) threshold is needed.
%
%   bwindow = (50) time in ms from zero region program looks for
%   blink onset, offset. This number should be restricted in general to
%   avoid points not associated with the blink from being chosen. It also
%   should be less than betblink to avoid interpolation using data from 
%   another blink region.
%
%   betblink = (75) the minimum duration in ms required
%   to form a valid region of data. This prevents small interblink
%   regions of fluctuating data from being included in the trial and
%   affecting the interpolations. betblink is also used to define the max
%   t1-t2 and t3-t4 distance. Restricting this distance allows the
%   interpolation to better reflect the data surrounding the blink. In
%   general, the smaller this number, the flatter the interpolation.
